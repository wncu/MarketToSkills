# Go-Rod Browser Automation Master

## Detailed Guide

Read [the detailed guide](references/detailed-guide.md) before executing this skill. It retains the complete procedure and reference material. Treat its safety, prerequisites, and validation requirements as mandatory. For focused work, load the relevant sections; for end-to-end work, read the guide completely.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when the user asks to **scrape**, **automate**, or **test** a website using Go.
- Use when the user needs a **headless browser** for dynamic/SPA content (React, Vue, Angular).
- Use when the user mentions **stealth**, **anti-bot**, **avoiding detection**, **Cloudflare**, or **bot detection bypass**.
- Use when the user wants to work with the **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** directly from Go.
- Use when the user needs to **intercept** or **hijack** network requests in a browser context.
- Use when the user asks about **concurrent browser scraping** or **page pooling** in Go.
- Use when the user is migrating from **chromedp** or **Playwright Go** and wants a simpler API.

## Safety & Risk

**Risk Level: 🔵 Safe**

- **Read-Only by Default:** Default behavior is navigating and reading page content (scraping/testing).
- **Isolated Contexts:** Browser contexts are sandboxed; cookies and storage do not persist unless explicitly saved.
- **Resource Cleanup:** Designed around Go's `defer` pattern — browsers and pages close automatically.
- **No External Mutations:** Does not modify external state unless the script explicitly submits forms or POSTs data.

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for complete, runnable Go files:
- `examples/basic_scrape.go` — Minimal scraping example
- `examples/stealth_page.go` — Anti-detection with go-rod/stealth
- `examples/request_hijacking.go` — Intercepting and modifying network requests
- `examples/concurrent_pages.go` — Page pool for concurrent scraping

## Limitations

- **CAPTCHAs:** Rod does not include CAPTCHA solving. External services (2captcha, etc.) must be integrated separately.
- **Extreme Anti-Bot:** While `go-rod/stealth` handles common detection (WebDriver, plugin fingerprints, WebGL), extremely strict systems (some Cloudflare configurations, Akamai Bot Manager) may still detect automation. Additional measures (residential proxies, human-like behavioral patterns) may be needed.
- **DRM Content:** Cannot interact with DRM-protected media (e.g., Widevine).
- **Resource Usage:** Each browser instance consumes significant RAM (~100-300MB+). Use `PagePool` and limit concurrency on memory-constrained systems.
- **Extensions in Headless:** Chrome extensions do not work in headless mode. Use `Headless(false)` with XVFB for server environments.
- **Platform:** Requires a Chromium-compatible browser. Does not support Firefox or Safari.
