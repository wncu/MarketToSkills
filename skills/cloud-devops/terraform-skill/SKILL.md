# Terraform Skill for Claude

Comprehensive Terraform and OpenTofu guidance covering testing, modules, CI/CD, and production patterns. Based on terraform-best-practices.com and enterprise experience.

## Detailed Guide

Read [the detailed guide](references/detailed-guide.md) before executing this skill. It retains the complete procedure and reference material. Treat its safety, prerequisites, and validation requirements as mandatory. For focused work, load the relevant sections; for end-to-end work, read the guide completely.

## When to Use This Skill

**Activate this skill when:**
- Creating new Terraform or OpenTofu configurations or modules
- Setting up testing infrastructure for IaC code
- Deciding between testing approaches (validate, plan, frameworks)
- Structuring multi-environment deployments
- Implementing CI/CD for infrastructure-as-code
- Reviewing or refactoring existing Terraform/OpenTofu projects
- Choosing between module patterns or state management approaches

**Don't use this skill for:**
- Basic Terraform/OpenTofu syntax questions (Claude knows this)
- Provider-specific API reference (link to docs instead)
- Cloud platform questions unrelated to Terraform/OpenTofu

## Count vs For_Each: When to Use Each

### Quick Decision Guide

| Scenario | Use | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Boolean condition (create or don't) | `count = condition ? 1 : 0` | Simple on/off toggle |
| Simple numeric replication | `count = 3` | Fixed number of identical resources |
| Items may be reordered/removed | `for_each = toset(list)` | Stable resource addresses |
| Reference by key | `for_each = map` | Named access to resources |
| Multiple named resources | `for_each` | Better maintainability |

### Common Patterns

**Boolean conditions:**
```hcl
# ✅ GOOD - Boolean condition
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "this" {
  count = var.create_nat_gateway ? 1 : 0
  # ...
}
```

**Stable addressing with for_each:**
```hcl
# ✅ GOOD - Removing "us-east-1b" only affects that subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  for_each = toset(var.availability_zones)

  availability_zone = each.key
  # ...
}

# ❌ BAD - Removing middle AZ recreates all subsequent subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  count = length(var.availability_zones)

  availability_zone = var.availability_zones[count.index]
  # ...
}
```

**For migration guides and detailed examples, see:** Code Patterns: Count vs For_Each

## Security & Compliance

### Essential Security Checks

```bash
# Static security scanning
trivy config .
checkov -d .
```

### Common Issues to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Store secrets in variables
- Use default VPC
- Skip encryption
- Open security groups to 0.0.0.0/0

✅ **Do:**
- Use AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store
- Create dedicated VPCs
- Enable encryption at rest
- Use least-privilege security groups

**For detailed security guidance, see:**
- **Security & Compliance Guide** - Trivy/Checkov integration, secrets management, state file security, compliance testing

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
