# Standards and References — Conducting GDPR Compliance Assessment

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0

| ID | Category | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| GV.OC-02 | Organizational Context: Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements regarding cybersecurity are understood and managed | GDPR is a primary legal/regulatory requirement for organizations processing EU resident data; understanding its applicability (Article 3) and requirements is foundational to governance. |
| GV.PO-01 | Policy: Organizational cybersecurity policy is established, communicated, and enforced | GDPR Article 5 accountability principle and Article 24 controller responsibilities require documented data protection policies aligned with GDPR principles. |
| GV.RM-04 | Risk Management Strategy: Strategic direction that describes appropriate risk response options is established and communicated | DPIAs (Article 35) and controller accountability (Article 24) mandate risk-based approaches to data protection; risk tolerance must be documented and communicated. |
| PR.DS-01 | Data Security: Data-at-rest is protected | Article 32 requires encryption and pseudonymization as technical measures appropriate to the risk; data-at-rest encryption directly implements this. |
| PR.DS-02 | Data Security: Data-in-transit is protected | Article 32 confidentiality/integrity; TLS 1.2+ for all personal data transmission implements this security baseline. |
| ID.AM-05 | Asset Management: Resources are prioritized based on classification, criticality, and business value | Article 30 records of processing categorize personal data by sensitivity (special category under Article 9 vs. general); this informs security prioritization. |

## MITRE ATT&CK

| Technique ID | Name | Tactic | Rationale |
|--------------|------|--------|-----------|
| T1530 | Data from Cloud Storage Object | Collection | Unauthorized access to cloud-stored personal data represents a data breach under GDPR Article 4(12); assessing cloud security controls (access logs, IAM) validates Article 32 compliance. |
| T1567 | Exfiltration Over Web Service | Exfiltration | Data exfiltration scenarios (T1567.002 to cloud, T1567.004 over encrypted channel) constitute personal data breaches; GDPR Article 33 breach notification and Article 32 exfiltration prevention controls directly address this. |
