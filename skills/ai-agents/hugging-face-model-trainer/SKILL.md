# TRL Training on Hugging Face Jobs

## Detailed Guide

Read [the detailed guide](references/detailed-guide.md) before executing this skill. It retains the complete procedure and reference material. Treat its safety, prerequisites, and validation requirements as mandatory. For focused work, load the relevant sections; for end-to-end work, read the guide completely.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users want to:
- Fine-tune language models on cloud GPUs without local infrastructure
- Train with TRL methods (SFT, DPO, GRPO, etc.)
- Run training jobs on Hugging Face Jobs infrastructure
- Convert trained models to GGUF for local deployment (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp)
- Ensure trained models are permanently saved to the Hub
- Use modern workflows with optimized defaults

### When to Use Unsloth

Use **Unsloth** (`references/unsloth.md`) instead of standard TRL when:
- **Limited GPU memory** - Unsloth uses ~60% less VRAM
- **Speed matters** - Unsloth is ~2x faster
- Training **large models (>13B)** - memory efficiency is critical
- Training **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** - Unsloth has `FastVisionModel` support

See `references/unsloth.md` for complete Unsloth documentation and `scripts/unsloth_sft_example.py` for a production-ready training script.

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting any training job, verify:

### ✅ **Account & Authentication**
- Hugging Face Account with [Pro](https://hf.co/pro), [Team](https://hf.co/enterprise), or [Enterprise](https://hf.co/enterprise) plan (Jobs require paid plan)
- Authenticated login: Check with `hf_whoami()`
- **HF_TOKEN for Hub Push** ⚠️ CRITICAL - Training environment is ephemeral, must push to Hub or ALL training results are lost
- Token must have write permissions
- **MUST pass `secrets={"HF_TOKEN": "$HF_TOKEN"}` in job config** to make token available (the `$HF_TOKEN` syntax
  references your actual token value)

### ✅ **Dataset Requirements**
- Dataset must exist on Hub or be loadable via `datasets.load_dataset()`
- Format must match training method (SFT: "messages"/text/prompt-completion; DPO: chosen/rejected; GRPO: prompt-only)
- **ALWAYS validate unknown datasets** before GPU training to prevent format failures (see Dataset Validation section below)
- Size appropriate for hardware (Demo: 50-100 examples on t4-small; Production: 1K-10K+ on a10g-large/a100-large)

### ⚠️ **Critical Settings**
- **Timeout must exceed expected training time** - Default 30min is TOO SHORT for most training. Minimum recommended: 1-2 hours. Job fails and loses all progress if timeout is exceeded.
- **Hub push must be enabled** - Config: `push_to_hub=True`, `hub_model_id="username/model-name"`; Job: `secrets={"HF_TOKEN": "$HF_TOKEN"}`

## Example Training Scripts

**Production-ready templates with all best practices:**

Load these scripts for correctly:

- **`scripts/train_sft_example.py`** - Complete SFT training with Trackio, LoRA, checkpoints
- **`scripts/train_dpo_example.py`** - DPO training for preference learning
- **`scripts/train_grpo_example.py`** - GRPO training for online RL

These scripts demonstrate proper Hub saving, Trackio integration, checkpoint management, and optimized parameters. Pass their content inline to `hf_jobs()` or use as templates for custom scripts.

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream product or API scope.
- Verify commands, API behavior, pricing, quotas, credentials, and deployment effects against current official documentation before making changes.
- Do not treat generated examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
