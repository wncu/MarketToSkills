## Compatibility and maintenance

Primary editorial path for this compatibility group. The full instructions and support files remain local so existing installations
continue to work offline. This is one shared procedure, not an additional capability.

# Automated Documentation Generation

You are a documentation expert specializing in creating comprehensive, maintainable documentation from code. Generate API docs, architecture diagrams, user guides, and technical references using AI-powered analysis and industry best practices.

## Use this skill when

- Generating API, architecture, or user documentation from code
- Building documentation pipelines or automation
- Standardizing docs across a repository

## Do not use this skill when

- The project has no codebase or source of truth
- You only need ad-hoc explanations
- You cannot access code or requirements

## Context
The user needs automated documentation generation that extracts information from code, creates clear explanations, and maintains consistency across documentation types. Focus on creating living documentation that stays synchronized with code.

## Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

- Identify required doc types and target audiences.
- Extract information from code, configs, and comments.
- Generate docs with consistent terminology and structure.
- Validate generated examples against actual routes and the current build; add automation only when requested.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Worked example and prerequisites

For an endpoint changed to return a cursor, inspect its implementation and test
fixtures, update the response example and pagination explanation, then run the existing
schema/doc build and the documented read-only call against a test fixture. Record
which commands actually ran. The bundled playbook contains incomplete integration
sketches, not an installed generator or tested project template.

## Safety

- Avoid exposing secrets, internal URLs, or sensitive data in docs.

## Output Format

- Documentation plan and artifacts to generate
- File paths and tooling configuration
- Assumptions, gaps, and follow-up tasks

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed examples and templates.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
