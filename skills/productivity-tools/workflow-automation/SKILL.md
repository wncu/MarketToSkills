# Workflow Automation

Workflow automation is the infrastructure that makes AI agents reliable.
Without durable execution, a network hiccup during a 10-step payment
flow means lost money and angry customers. With it, workflows resume
exactly where they left off.

This skill covers the platforms (n8n, Temporal, Inngest) and patterns
(sequential, parallel, orchestrator-worker) that turn brittle scripts
into production-grade automation.

Key insight: The platforms make different tradeoffs. n8n optimizes for
accessibility, Temporal for correctness, Inngest for developer experience.
Pick based on your actual needs, not hype.

## Detailed Guide

Read [the detailed guide](references/detailed-guide.md) before executing this skill. It retains the complete procedure and reference material. Treat its safety, prerequisites, and validation requirements as mandatory. For focused work, load the relevant sections; for end-to-end work, read the guide completely.

## Inngest Example (TypeScript)
"""
import { inngest } from "./client";

export const processOrder = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "process-order" },
  { event: "order/created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Step 1: Validate order
    const validated = await step.run("validate-order", async () => {
      return validateOrder(event.data.order);
    });

    // Step 2: Process payment (durable - survives crashes)
    const payment = await step.run("process-payment", async () => {
      return chargeCard(validated.paymentMethod, validated.total);
    });

    // Step 3: Create shipment
    const shipment = await step.run("create-shipment", async () => {
      return createShipment(validated.items, validated.address);
    });

    // Step 4: Send confirmation
    await step.run("send-confirmation", async () => {
      return sendEmail(validated.email, { payment, shipment });
    });

    return { success: true, orderId: event.data.orderId };
  }
);
"""

## Temporal Example (TypeScript)
"""
import { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
import type * as activities from './activities';

const { validateOrder, chargeCard, createShipment, sendEmail } =
  proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
    startToCloseTimeout: '30 seconds',
    retry: {
      maximumAttempts: 3,
      backoffCoefficient: 2,
    }
  });

export async function processOrderWorkflow(order: Order): Promise<void> {
  const validated = await validateOrder(order);
  const payment = await chargeCard(validated.paymentMethod, validated.total);
  const shipment = await createShipment(validated.items, validated.address);
  await sendEmail(validated.email, { payment, shipment });
}
"""

## Inngest Example
"""
export const analyzeDocument = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "analyze-document" },
  { event: "document/uploaded" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Run analyses in parallel
    const [security, performance, compliance] = await Promise.all([
      step.run("security-analysis", () =>
        analyzeForSecurityIssues(event.data.document)
      ),
      step.run("performance-analysis", () =>
        analyzeForPerformance(event.data.document)
      ),
      step.run("compliance-analysis", () =>
        analyzeForCompliance(event.data.document)
      ),
    ]);

    // Aggregate results
    const report = await step.run("generate-report", () =>
      generateReport({ security, performance, compliance })
    );

    return report;
  }
);
"""

## Temporal Example
"""
export async function orchestratorWorkflow(task: ComplexTask) {
  // Orchestrator decides what work needs to be done
  const plan = await analyzeTask(task);

  // Dispatch to specialized worker workflows
  const results = await Promise.all(
    plan.subtasks.map(subtask => {
      switch (subtask.type) {
        case 'create':
          return executeChild(createWorkerWorkflow, { args: [subtask] });
        case 'modify':
          return executeChild(modifyWorkerWorkflow, { args: [subtask] });
        case 'delete':
          return executeChild(deleteWorkerWorkflow, { args: [subtask] });
      }
    })
  );

  // Aggregate results
  return aggregateResults(results);
}
